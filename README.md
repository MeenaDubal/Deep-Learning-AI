# Deep-Learning-AI
Projects using Deep Leaning model like MLP, CNN, NLP, Keras.                                                                                                                 
1. MLP Project:        
    To look into Wine fraud that has occurred recently at your firm,it has various chemical features of different wines, all grown in the same region in Italy, but the data is labeled by three different possible cultivars.

2. NLP Project:        
    From extracted through the Wikipedia.py script. Build an LSTM based Neural Network that could generate content given any 2 input words.

3. Project using Keras:        
    Binary Classification on ‘Customer_Churn’using Keras for a telecom company “Leo” whose customers are churning out to its competitors.Analyze the data of your company find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.
Customer churn, in simple terms means that the customer has stopped doing business with the company and this is a common problem when it comes to telecom industries. To avoid this, companies use predictive analysis to gauge the factors responsible for a customer to leave the company. These churn prediction models help in finding out the customer base that are most likely to churn out. 

4. RNN Assignmet :
